FootLinker Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the FootLinker App!

You can find here details about the product (or mini-app or module), from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of Rational Unified Process): 

* Business modeling 
  * [Product Vision](docs/ProductVision.md)
  * [Elevator Pitch](docs/ElevatorPitch.md)
* [Requirements](docs/Requirements.md)
  * [Domain model](docs/Requirements.md#Domain-model)
* [Architecture and Design](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md)
  * [Logical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#architecture-and-design)
  * [Physical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#physical-architecture)
  * [Vertical prototype](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#vertical-prototype)
* [Implementation]
* [Test]
* [Configuration and change management]
* [Project management](docs/ProjectManagement.md)

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.
