## Project management

You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Iteration backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/37);
* Release management: [v0](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC07T5/releases/tag/v0), [v1](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC07T5/releases/tag/v1), [v2](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC07T5/releases/tag/v2);
* Iteration planning and retrospectives.

### Iteration 0

**Plan:**

**Retrospective:**

In our opinion, Iteration 0 went well because we completed all the tasks we were proposed to do on time and with quality. We shared tasks among the team and we communicated well on how to resolve them.

For the following iterations, we should consider managing our time in a better way. We were on a little rush at the end of Iteration 0 in order to complete everything on time, so our estimations could have been better.

We feel that we are not yet able to do accurate estimations of effort and time, thus this is something that still puzzles us.

### Iteration 1

**Plan:**

**Retrospective:**

We think that Iteration 1 went smoothly because we implemented all three features planned for this iteration. Besides this, we believe that the features were well implemented, useful and functional.

The one problem we faced was the lack of communication between our team. This resulted in one feature that was left to be completed very close to the deadline.

One thing that still puzzles us is related to the interaction with the API - it is a little unreliable and it has a limit of 100 request each day which complicates testing.

### Iteration 2
