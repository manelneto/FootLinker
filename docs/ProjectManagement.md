## Project management

You can find below information and references related with the project management in our team: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Iteration backlog in a Github Projects board;
* Release management: [v0](https://github.com/manelneto/FootLinker/releases/tag/v0), [v1](https://github.com/manelneto/FootLinker/releases/tag/v1), [v2](https://github.com/manelneto/FootLinker/releases/tag/v2), [v3](https://github.com/manelneto/FootLinker/releases/tag/v3); [v4](https://github.com/manelneto/FootLinker/releases/tag/v4)
* Iteration planning and retrospectives.

### Iteration 0

**Plan:**

**Retrospective:**

In our opinion, Iteration 0 went well because we completed all the tasks we were proposed to do on time and with quality. We shared tasks among the team and we communicated well on how to resolve them.

For the following iterations, we should consider managing our time in a better way. We were on a little rush at the end of Iteration 0 in order to complete everything on time, so our estimations could have been better.

We feel that we are not yet able to do accurate estimations of effort and time, thus this is something that still puzzles us.

### Iteration 1

**Plan:**

**Retrospective:**

We think that Iteration 1 went smoothly because we implemented all three features planned for this iteration. Besides this, we believe that the features were well implemented, useful and functional.

The one problem we faced was the lack of communication between our team. This resulted in one feature that was left to be completed very close to the deadline.

One thing that still puzzles us is related to the interaction with the API - it is a little unreliable and it has a limit of 100 request each day which complicates testing.

### Iteration 2

**Plan:**

![End of Iteration 2](/images/iteration2end.png)

**Retrospective:**

We believe that Iteration 2 went as planned and resulted in a great product increment. The major factor that contributed to this was that the tasks were distributed in a balanced way among the teams members and everyone did their job.

The biggest issue was that we were not all working at the same pace, which combined with the massive workload led to pushing the integration of some features closer to the deadline than we hoped.

Something that keeps puzzling us is how to improve the use of GitHub Actions to do continuous integration and run the acceptance tests.

### Iteration 3

**Plan:**

![End of Iteration 3](/images/iteration3end.png)

**Retrospective:**

In our belief, Iteration 3 went exceedingly well and improved the previous version of the app. This happened due to better iteration planning which allowed us to implement each feature with an increased attention to detail.

Our biggest obstacle this iteration was running the Acceptance Tests with GitHub Actions. The tests were taking too long to complete, which led to some time wasted while waiting to check the results.

What keeps intriguing us is the integration of Firebase on our app (mainly sending and retrieving data).

### Iteration 4

**Plan:**
