### Iteration 0

**Plan:**

**Retrospective:**

In our opinion, Iteration 0 went well because we completed all the tasks we were proposed to do on time and with quality. We shared tasks among the team and we communicated well on how to resolve them.

For the following iterations, we should consider managing our time in a better way. We were on a little rush at the end of Iteration 0 in order to complete everything on time, so our estimations could have been better.

We feel that we are not yet able to do accurate estimations of effort and time, and this is something that still puzzles us.

Software project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we recommend each team to adopt a set of project management practices and tools capable of registering tasks, assigning tasks to team members, adding estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Common practices of managing iterative software development are: backlog management, release management, estimation, iteration planning, iteration development, acceptance tests, and retrospectives.

* Release management: [v0](#), v1, v2, v3, v...;
* Iteration planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: screenshots of Github Projects board at begin and end of each iteration;
  * retrospectives: meeting notes in a document in the repository
