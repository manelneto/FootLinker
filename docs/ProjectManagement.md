**Retrospective:**

In our opinion, Iteration 0 went well because we completed all the tasks we were proposed to do on time and with quality. We shared tasks among the team and we communicated well on how to resolve them.

For the following iterations, we should consider managing our time in a better way. We were on a little rush at the end of Iteration 0 in order to complete everything on time, so our estimations could have been better.

We feel that we are not yet able to do accurate estimations of effort and time, thus this is something that still puzzles us.
